# [Font Sizer](https://leonides.dev/font-sizer)

Simple tool for calculating CSS font size units.

## About

As a web developer, I frequently found myself wrestling with the conversion between pixels and rems when setting font sizes in CSS.

Calculating these conversions manually â€“ especially when dealing with multiple font sizes â€“ is a tedious and error-prone process.

This tool provides a quick and accurate way to convert pixel values into rems, allowing you to maintain a consistent and scalable typography system.

Ultimately, itâ€™s about reducing friction and making your CSS workflow more efficient.

### Features

- ðŸ§® Calculate font size in px from rem, vice versa
- ðŸ“‹ Quick reference table of common font sizes
